 GitHub API to retrieve repository data :
- Fetch and display a list of repositories for a specific GitHub user or organization.
- Filter repositories by programming language.
- Display detailed information about a selected repository.
- Implement pagination to load more repositories as the user scrolls.
- Handle potential errors (e.g., API rate limits, network failures) gracefully.
